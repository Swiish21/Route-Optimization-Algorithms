Overview
This is a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

Usage
To use this implementation, simply call the dijkstra function with a graph represented as a dictionary of dictionaries, where each inner dictionary represents the neighbors of a node and their corresponding weights.

Output
The dijkstra function returns a dictionary of shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.

Notes
This implementation assumes that the graph is represented as a dictionary of dictionaries, where each inner dictionary represents the neighbors of a node and their corresponding weights.
The graph should be connected, meaning that there is a path from the start node to all other nodes.
The implementation uses a priority queue to efficiently select the next node to process.
